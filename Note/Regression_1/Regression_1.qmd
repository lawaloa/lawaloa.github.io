Completing the course on **Introduction to Regression with statsmodels in Python**, I gained a comprehensive understanding of regression analysis and its application in Python. Here's a summary of what I learned:

1. **Fundamentals of Regression**: I learned the basics of regression analysis, including the difference between linear and logistic regression models.

2. **Fitting Simple Linear Regression Models**: I explored how to fit linear regression models with both numeric and categorical explanatory variables and how to interpret model coefficients to describe relationships between the response and explanatory variables.

3. **Making Predictions**: I learned how to use linear regression models to make predictions on various datasets, providing actionable insights from the model's outputs.

4. **Regression to the Mean**: I gained an understanding of the concept of “regression to the mean” and its implications in statistical analysis.

5. **Transforming Variables**: I explored techniques to transform variables in a dataset to improve model performance and interpretability.

6. **Model Assessment**: I learned how to evaluate the fit of a regression model by asking specific questions and using diagnostic techniques to assess its accuracy.

7. **Model Diagnostics**: I discovered how to quantify the quality of model fits, diagnose problems with visualizations, and understand the influence of each observation, including its leverage, on the final model.

8. **Fitting Logistic Regression Models**: I learned how to fit logistic regression models, focusing on real-world applications. For example, I predicted the likelihood of a customer closing their bank account, interpreted probabilities of success, and understood odds ratios.

9. **Model Performance Evaluation**: I also learned how to assess model performance using confusion matrices, which help quantify the effectiveness of logistic regression predictions.
