The Great Tables package is ideal for crafting beautiful, high-quality tables for reports, publications, and data presentations. Effective tables typically share three key characteristics:

1.  structuring that aids in the reading of the table.

2.  well-formatted values, fitting expectations for the field of study.

3.  styling that reduces time to insight and improves aesthetics.

## Key Skills Acquired:

1.  **Adding Explanatory Footnotes and Source Notes**

-   Used`tab_source_note()` to append footnotes or cite data sources directly within the table.

-   Provided helpful context for interpretation and ensured reproducibility.

2.  **Adjusting Column Widths with** (`cols_width`)

-   Resized specific columns to optimize space usage, especially for wide or dense datasets.

-   Improved layout and prevented content overflow.

3.  **Formatting Table Values with** `fmt_*()` **Functions**

-   Applied formatting to numeric values, dates, percentages, and more to enhance clarity and alignment with standards in scientific or business reporting.

4.  **Styling Enhancements Using** `data_color()`, `cols_align()` **and** `tab_options()`

-   Applied conditional coloring (`data_color()`) to emphasize data ranges or categories.

-   Aligned columns (`cols_align()`) for consistency and readability.

-   Customized general table aesthetics using `tab_options()` to refine spacing, borders, and fonts.
