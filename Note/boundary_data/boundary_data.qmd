Country **borders** and **boundaries** serve multiple purposes. They can be used as a background in thematic maps, as delimiters for other spatial data, or to identify spread patterns and calculate the intersection between spatial objects (e.g., points within polygons).

Accessing this type of data may produce *different outputs*, such as **low- or high-resolution borders or varying administrative levels**. The choice of resolution or administrative detail depends on your specific requirements.

In this lesson, I learned how to access:

- **Low-resolution boundaries** of continents and countries using the `{rnaturalearth}` package.

- **High-resolution boundaries** of continents and countries with the `{rgeoboundaries}` package.

- Additional geographic data using the `{geodata}` package.
