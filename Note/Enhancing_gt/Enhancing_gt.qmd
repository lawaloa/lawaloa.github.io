Building on the foundation of the previous [{gt} lesson](https://lawaloa.github.io/Organizing_with_gt/){target="_blank"} — which focused on table structure and manipulation—I learned how to use the `{gt}` package to polish, style, and customize tables, enhancing the quality and efficiency of data reports.

## Key Skills Gained:

1. **Applying Pre-Defined Themes** (`opt_stylize`)

- Learned to apply pre-defined styles and color themes to tables using the `opt_stylize()` function. Explored different style numbers and color choices to enhance visual appeal.

2. **Formatting Table Values** (`data_color`)

- Used the `data_color()` function to highlight key values in specific columns, making large datasets more interpretable.

3. **Conditional Formatting** (`tab_style`)

- Mastered conditional formatting by applying styles to table cells when they meet specific conditions or thresholds.

4. **Enhancing Table Text (Fonts & Colors)**

- Customized table titles, subtitles, and other text elements with different fonts and colors using `gt::tab_style()`.

5. **Adding Borders** (`tab_style` **&** `cell_borders`)

- Learned to draw borders within tables to highlight specific sections, adjusting line color and thickness for better readability.
