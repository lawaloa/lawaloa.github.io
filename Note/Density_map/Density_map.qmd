A **density map** is a type of thematic map that uses colors to represent the *intensity* of a value. Unlike traditional maps, it doesn't rely on predefined regions or geopolitical boundaries but highlights 'hot spots'â€”areas with high density or concentration of points.

Through this course, I gained the skills to:

-   Build *density maps* commonly used by epidemiologists to visualize overlapping geospatial data.
-   Enhance **thematic maps** with **basemaps** (Google Maps-like backgrounds) using the `annotation_map_tile()` function from the `{ggspatial}` package.
