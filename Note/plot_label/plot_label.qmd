Bar plots are among the most versatile chart types, with numerous variations for visualizing data. In a [previous lesson](https://lawaloa.github.io/Bar_chart/){target="_blank"}, I learned how to create bar plots and their circular counterparts using `{ggplot2}`. Building on that foundation, this lesson focused on enhancing visualizations through effective labeling and data transformation.

Key takeaways from this lesson include:

1.  **Using Text Geoms for Labeling**

-   Applied `geom_text()` for simple labels.
-   Used `geom_label()` for more emphasized labels.

2.  **Data Preparation**

-   Transformed and summarized data into the appropriate formats for various chart types.

3.  **Label Placement on Bar Plots**

-   Positioned labels accurately on stacked, dodged, and percent-stacked bar plots.

4.  **Label Placement on Circular Charts**

-   Adjusted label placement effectively on pie charts and donut plots.

This lesson significantly improved my skills in creating and customizing labeled bar and circular plots, ensuring clear and effective data communication.
