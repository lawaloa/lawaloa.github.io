Building on the knowledge gained in [Part 1 of the course on date analysis in R](https://lawaloa.github.io/date_1/){target="_blank"}, this lesson helped me strengthen my ability to perform basic date analyses. I learned techniques such as calculating intervals between dates and creating time series graphs. These skills are essential for health data professionals, as they form the foundation for understanding temporal patterns, including disease progression over time and fluctuations in population health metrics across various periods.
