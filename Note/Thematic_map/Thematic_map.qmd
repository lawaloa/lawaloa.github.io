After completing this course, I have gained the following skills:

1.  **Understanding Thematic Maps**:

-   I can identify and explain two key types of thematic maps commonly used in epidemiology:

    -   **Choropleth Maps**: Used to represent spatial data variations based on areas.
    -   **Dot Maps**: Used to show the distribution of phenomena using dots or symbols.

2.  **Creating Thematic Maps**:

-   I can effectively create thematic maps in R using the `{ggplot2}` package and the `geom_sf()` function, leveraging its flexibility to visualize geospatial data.

3.  **Relating Maps to Geometry Types**:

-   I have learned how each type of thematic map aligns with specific geometry types, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of data visualization.
