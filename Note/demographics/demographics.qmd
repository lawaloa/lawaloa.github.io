A demographic pyramid, also known as a population or age-sex pyramid, is a powerful tool for visualizing population distribution by **age** and **sex**.

This tool becomes particularly valuable when analyzing disease patterns across these demographic variables.

Through this learning experience, I have gained the following skills and insights:

1.  **Understanding the Value of Demographic Pyramids**:

-   Recognized their importance in communicating **age- and sex-specific patterns** of disease distribution.
-   Conceptualized **the demographic pyramid** as a modified **stacked bar plot**.

2.  **Data Preparation**

-   Learned to **summarize and structure data** for plotting using `{dplyr}` functions.

3.  **Plotting with** `{ggplot2}`

-   **Created demographic pyramids** with `geom_col()`, displaying total counts or percentages on the x-axis.

4.  **Customization**

-   Enhanced plots by adjusting the color scheme, labels, and axes for clear communication and visual appeal.

This comprehensive learning journey has equipped me with the skills to effectively use demographic pyramids for epidemiological analysis.
