Repetition is a fundamental concept in programming, often essential for automating tasks. In R, a **for loop** provides an efficient way to repeat a task multiple times, saving both time and effort. Through the course, I have gained the ability to:

1. **Explain the syntax and structure** of a basic for loop in R.
2. **Utilize index variables** to iterate through multiple vectors simultaneously within a loop.
3. **Incorporate if/else conditional statements** to add decision-making within loops.
4. **Store loop results** in vectors and lists for further analysis.
5. **Apply loops** to real-world tasks such as analyzing multiple datasets and generating multiple plots.
6. **Debug loops** effectively by isolating and testing individual iterations.

This knowledge equips me to handle repetitive tasks in R with greater precision and efficiency.
