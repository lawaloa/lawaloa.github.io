## Mastering Time Series Visualization for Epidemiology

Understanding `time series data` is crucial in epidemiologyâ€”it helps uncover trends, detect disease outbreaks, and drive data-informed decisions for better health outcomes.

In my latest learning journey, I explored how to leverage `ggplot2` and the `tidyverse` to visualize time series data effectively.

## Key Skills Gained

1.  Reshaping time series data using `pivot_longer()` for better plotting.

2. Creating clear and insightful **line graphs** in `ggplot2`.

3. Enhancing visualization aesthetics with **custom labels**, **color palettes**, and **annotations**.

4. Ability to use `geom_ribbon()` to display **confidence intervals**.

5. Applying smoothing techniques to highlight **patterns in noisy data**.

6. Comparing multiple time series using **dual axes** with `sec_axis()`
