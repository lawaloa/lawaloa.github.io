Completing the **Hypothesis Testing in Python** course has enhanced my understanding of the **one-sample proportion test** workflow. Along the way, I explored key concepts such as **z-scores, p-values, and Type I and Type II errors**. Below is a summary of my learning journey:

1.  **Hypothesis Tests and Z-Scores** – I examined a real-world case where hypothesis testing played a crucial role in decision-making.

2.  **Two-Sample and ANOVA Tests** – I learned how to compare means between two groups using **t-tests** and extended this to multiple groups using **ANOVA** and **pairwise t-tests**.

3.  **Proportion Tests** – Through hands-on exercises, I applied **chi-square independence tests** to compare proportions across multiple groups and revisited the **one-sample case** with **chi-square goodness-of-fit tests**.

4.  **Non-Parametric Tests** – I explored the assumptions underlying **parametric tests** and learned how **non-parametric tests** serve as alternatives when those assumptions are violated.
