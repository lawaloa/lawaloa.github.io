During this learning journey, I have developed a clear understanding of key concepts and skills for data visualization:

1.  **Comparisons vs. Compositions**

-   Differentiated between visualizing comparisons (showing differences between categories) and visualizing compositions (showing parts of a whole).

-   Learned to identify appropriate chart types for these two types of analysis.

2.  **Bar Charts**

-   Created and customized bar charts for comparing categorical data using `geom_col()`, `geom_errorbar()`, and position adjustments.

3.  **Pie Charts**

-   Designed and customized pie charts to visualize compositions using `coord_polar()` with `geom_col()`.

These skills have enhanced my ability to present data effectively for comparison and composition analysis using `{ggplot2}`.
