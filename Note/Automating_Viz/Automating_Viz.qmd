In many real-world data analysis tasks, especially in epidemiology, we often need to generate the same type of plots for multiple regions or indicators. In this lesson, I learned how to automate such repetitive plotting workflows by combining the power of `{ggplot2}` and `{purrr}` in `R`.

I began by exploring the programmatic capabilities of {ggplot2}, building reusable, custom plotting functions to streamline graph creation. I then used {purrr} to iterate over subsets of data and variables, allowing me to automatically generate and save multiple plots in a single step. This automation not only improved my efficiency but also ensured consistency across visual outputs.

## Key Skills Gained:

1. **Identifying Repetitive Plotting Tasks**

- Recognized when repetitive filtering and plotting are necessary and designed structured workflows to handle them efficiently.

2. **Creating Custom Plotting Functions**

- Built flexible plotting functions that support dynamic inputs for subsetting data and customizing plots.

3. **Automating with** `purrr::map()`

- Used `map()` to iterate over a vector of variables and apply plotting functions automatically.

4. **Combining Iteration Techniques**

- Integrated `map()` inside for loops to generate plots across multiple combinations of subsets and indicators.
