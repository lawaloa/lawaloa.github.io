Building on the knowledge from [the previous lesson](https://lawaloa.github.io/data_clean_1/){target="_blank"} , where I explored various functions for diagnosing data issues, completing this lesson has enabled me to:

-   Understand and apply techniques to clean column names, both automatically and manually.
-   Effectively remove duplicate entries from datasets.
-   Correct and standardize string values in data.
-   Convert data types to suit specific requirements.

Check [here](https://lawaloa.github.io/data_clean_2/){target="_blank"} for details.
