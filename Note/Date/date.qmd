You’ll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It’s easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you’re going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You’ll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we’ll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you’ll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion. Check [here](https://lawaloa.github.io/Date/){target="_blank"} for details.
