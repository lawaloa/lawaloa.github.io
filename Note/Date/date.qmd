We may never have a **time machine**, but we do have `Python`—a powerful tool for analyzing time!️

Time-based data can get tricky with **day/month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time**, and more. But with the right techniques, we can **organize, analyze, and visualize** time data like pros.

In my latest learning journey, I worked with hurricane and bike trip datasets to:

-  Count events over time.
- Calculate time differences between events.
- Plot time series data effectively.
- Work with **Python, Pandas, and dateutil** (the only timezone library endorsed by Python’s official docs).

Now, I can confidently handle date and time data in any format—no confusion, just insights!
