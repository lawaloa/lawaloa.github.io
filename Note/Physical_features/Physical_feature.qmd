Understanding **geographic context** is essential for spatial data, as it helps in locating events in relation to *environmental features* like streets and landmarks.

Through this learning journey, I have gained the following skills:

-   Adding **physical features** to maps to enhance geographic context.
-   Plotting multiple layers on maps to complement thematic visualizations.
-   Relating physical features to their respective geometry types for accurate representation.
