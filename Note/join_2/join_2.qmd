Building on the knowledge gained in [Part 1 of the course on joining datasets in R](https://lawaloa.github.io/join/){target="_blank"}, this lesson enhanced my ability to work with messier and more complex datasets. I learned how to identify mismatched values between data frames, perform joins using one-to-many matches, and execute joins based on multiple key columns.
