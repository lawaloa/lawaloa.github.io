A **choropleth map** is a powerful thematic map where geographic regions are shaded or patterned based on the value of a specific variable. These maps are widely used in epidemiology, helping to visualize indicators such as **disease prevalence** or **mortality rates** across different regions. By displaying spatial patterns effectively, choropleth maps enhance data-driven decision-making.

# Key Skills Acquired

Through this course, I have gained expertise in:

1.  **Choropleth Maps with** \`{ggplot2}

-   Master the `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()` functions for creating visually appealing maps.

-   Learn how to customize map aesthetics, including colors, labels, and legends.

2.  **Data Matching with Geographic Polygons**

-   Acquiring and integrating boundary data with disease-related datasets.

-   Merging spatial and statistical data at different administrative levels.

3.  **Color Scaling Techniques**

-   Implement color scales for both continuous and discrete data types.

-   Choose appropriate color palettes to effectively communicate data trends and patterns.

4.  **Faceting for Map Visualization**

-   Use `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` to create small multiple maps.

-   Compare multiple variables or time periods side by side for deeper insights.

By mastering these techniques, I can now create **insightful, data-driven maps** that reveal meaningful geographic trends.
