Completing the **Introduction to Statistics in Python** course has strengthened my ability to summarize, analyze, and interpret data using Python. Along the way, I explored key concepts that form the foundation of statistical thinking. Below is a summary of what I learned:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Data Types and Measures of Center

-   Differentiated between **numeric** (discrete, continuous) and **categorical** (nominal, ordinal) data.
-   Learned how to summarize data with **mean, median, and mode**.
-   Discovered how **outliers** and **skewness** affect the choice of summary statistic.
-   Practiced using **histograms** to visualize sleep patterns in mammals.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Measures of Dispersion

-   Explored ways to describe how spread out data is, including:
    -   **Variance** and **Standard Deviation**\
    -   **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**\
    -   **Quantiles, Quartiles, and Interquartile Range (IQR)**\
-   Used **boxplots** to detect **outliers** and measure spread.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Probability and Randomness

-   Understood concepts of **independent vs. dependent events**.
-   Practiced **sampling from datasets** with and without replacement.
-   Applied **random seeds** for reproducibility.
-   Learned to calculate probabilities using **probability distributions**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Probability Distributions

-   Worked with **discrete distributions** like rolling dice and visualizing probability areas.
-   Learned the **binomial distribution** to model binary events (success/failure).
-   Applied **continuous distributions** such as:
    -   Uniform Distribution\
    -   Normal Distribution\
    -   Poisson Distribution\
    -   Exponential and Student’s t-distribution\
-   Practiced simulating real-world scenarios (e.g., waiting times, coin flips, and sales deals).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

-   Explored how **sample means** approximate a normal distribution, regardless of population shape.
-   Understood why **larger sample sizes** improve accuracy.
-   Applied CLT to both **numerical data** and **proportions**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Correlation

-   Learned how to measure and interpret relationships between two variables using the **correlation coefficient**.
-   Understood **strength (magnitude)** and **direction (sign)** of relationships.
-   Visualized correlations with **scatterplots and trendlines**.
-   Practiced calculating correlations using **Python libraries**.
-   Noted that correlation ≠ causation and explored **confounding variables**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Experimental Design

-   Distinguished between **observational studies** and **controlled experiments**.
-   Learned the **“gold standard”** principles of experiments: randomization, control groups, and replicability.
-   Understood differences between **longitudinal** and **cross-sectional studies**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Takeaways

-   Gained practical skills in **descriptive statistics, probability, and distributions**.\
-   Learned how to model uncertainty and variability with **statistical tools**.\
-   Built intuition for how **statistics informs decision-making** in real-world contexts.

This course laid a strong foundation for my journey into **data analysis and statistical modeling with Python**.
