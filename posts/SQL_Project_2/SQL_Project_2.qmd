This project is personal to me because it goes beyond running SQL queries — it’s about telling the story of the **Maji Ndogo water crisis** through data.

When I first explored the dataset, I didn’t just see rows and columns. I saw communities waiting in long queues, families depending on unsafe water, and field workers trying their best to bridge a massive gap.

Here’s how I approached it:\
- I started by **cleaning and validating the data** to make sure the foundation was trustworthy.\
- Then, I used **clustering and aggregation** to uncover the bigger narratives hidden beneath isolated records.\
- I treated each data point as someone’s lived experience — not just a number — which made **integrity checks and auditing** essential.

-   Finally, I zoomed in on both **granular details** (individual sources, employees, queues) and the **big picture** (provincial coverage, quality, and availability).

For me, this project isn’t just about technical SQL skills. It’s about showing how **data can become a voice** — turning hidden patterns into insights that can guide real-world solutions for the communities who need them most.
