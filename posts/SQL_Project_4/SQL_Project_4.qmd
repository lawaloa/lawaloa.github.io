This project is more than just a series of SQL queries — it was a **journey into applying data to drive real-world change**.  
By transforming raw water source data into actionable insights, I designed a framework for tracking, prioritizing, and improving **water accessibility across Maji Ndogo’s provinces**.

Through this analysis, I built a plan that helps identify which water sources to fix, upgrade, or monitor — enabling teams to **translate data into community impact**.  
What started as a database exercise became a hands-on example of how SQL supports **governance, transparency, and development**.

At its core, this project highlights that **SQL isn’t just for querying tables** — it’s a tool for building **systems of accountability**.  
From constructing relational models and using CASE logic for decisions, to developing the `Project_progress` table that tracks every intervention, each step reflected how structured data can guide sustainable action.

The story centers on the **Maji Ndogo Water Improvement Initiative**, where we analyzed the status of wells, rivers, shared taps, and in-home sources to build a province-wide plan for fair and efficient distribution.  
By combining SQL logic, conditional analysis, and project tracking, I developed a structured database solution that supports **field engineers, local authorities, and future monitoring efforts**.
