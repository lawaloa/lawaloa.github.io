Insurance companies invest significant resources into optimizing pricing strategies and accurately predicting the likelihood of customer claims. In many countries, car insurance is legally required for driving on public roads, making the market vast and competitive.

This project focused on building a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to file a claim during the policy period. The approach involved identifying the single feature that yielded the highest model accuracy, providing valuable insights for improved decision-making.
