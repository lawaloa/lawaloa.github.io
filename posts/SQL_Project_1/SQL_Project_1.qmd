This project focuses on analyzing a newly collected **database of 60,000 records** for **Maji Ndogo Water Services**.\
The data, gathered by engineers, scientists, field workers, and analysts, holds crucial insights to address the region’s ongoing water crisis.

The goal is to **explore, clean, and analyze** this extensive dataset to uncover patterns, identify challenges, and support data-driven decision-making.\
As part of the project, I broke down the work into actionable steps:

1.  **Data Familiarization** – Load and inspect all tables to understand structure, relationships, and variables.\
2.  **Water Source Analysis** – Identify all unique water source types and their distributions.\
3.  **Visit Pattern Exploration** – Analyze visit frequencies to different sources and flag high-traffic locations.\
4.  **Water Quality Assessment** – Filter sources with high subjective quality scores and frequent visits.\
5.  **Pollution Investigation** – Identify contaminated sources requiring urgent intervention.

By executing these tasks, I translate raw data into **meaningful insights** that can guide interventions, improve infrastructure planning, and ultimately bring Maji Ndogo closer to resolving its water crisis.

**Skills Applied**: SQL · Data Exploration · Data Cleaning · Filtering · Conditional Queries · Pattern Detection
