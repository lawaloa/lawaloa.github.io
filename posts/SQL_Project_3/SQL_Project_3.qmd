This project is more than just a collection of SQL queries — it was a journey into how **data can expose the truth hidden in plain sight**. By analyzing mismatches between surveyor reports and auditor scores, I uncovered patterns of mistakes that pointed to **potential corrupt practices**.

For me, this went far beyond practicing SQL syntax. It strengthened my understanding of how data analysis can be applied to **real-world challenges in governance, fairness, and accountability**.

At its core, this project shows how **SQL is not just about databases** — it is about using data as a **storytelling tool** to highlight issues that prevent communities from enjoying the resources that are rightfully theirs.

The story centers on an independent audit of the **Maji Ndogo water project**, where discrepancies in water source records demanded closer scrutiny. Through writing SQL queries, building Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and experimenting with joins, aggregations, and filtering, I explored how data can uncover both truths and irregularities — ultimately showing how analysis can **inform better governance and stronger institutions**.
