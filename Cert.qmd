### Continuous Learning Journey

As part of my ongoing commitment to lifelong learning and professional growth in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI Engineering**, I recently completed the **Fundamentals of Statistical Software & Analysis** course offered by the **University of Oxford, Medical Sciences Division**, earning a **Certificate of Completion**.

In addition, I successfully completed **Professional Development Skills for the Digital Age** and **Data Analytics** courses from **ALX**. These programs have further strengthened my analytical, technical, and professional capabilities — reinforcing my dedication to staying relevant and impactful in today’s data-driven world.
